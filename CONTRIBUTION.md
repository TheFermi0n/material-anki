If you want to add your own color and don't want me to go through the pain of doing it, please follow the following steps.

1. Visit the [Material Theme Builder website](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom). It will look something similar to the image below: ![Alt text](images/mtb.png)
2. Now click on the Primary color and change it with your color of choice.
3. After it creates a theme for you, click on the Export button and export it to `Web (CSS)`.
4. Extract the downloaded zip and you will see a `token.css` inside it.
5. Rename the `token.css` to `_md3-[the name of primary color the you have chosen].css`.
6. Place this inside the `color-schemes` folder of the forked repository.
7.
